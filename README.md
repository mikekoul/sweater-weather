## Overview

Our team is working in a service-oriented architecture building an application that can determine weather forecasts for a specified road trip, returning the weather to expect determined by arrival time at the destination. The front-end will communicate with your back-end through an API. Our job is to expose that API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.

Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
Expose an API that requires an authentication token
Expose an API for CRUD functionality
Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
Test both API consumption and exposure, making use of at least one mocking tool (VCR, Webmock, etc).
Return information in JSON format
